📊 Data Science Projects
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio Repository!
This repository showcases my journey in applying data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling to solve real-world problems. Each project demonstrates how I approach data-driven problem solving

📑 Contents
1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato Dataset
Performed in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns in restaurant data.
Analyzed factors such as restaurant ratings, cuisines, cost for two, location trends, and user preferences.
Visualized relationships between variables using plots and graphs.
Goal: To provide insights for restaurant businesses and customers by identifying key drivers of customer satisfaction.
Dataset: Zomato Dataset (Kaggle)

2️⃣ House Price Prediction (King County Dataset)
Built regression models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) to predict house prices based on features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition, and location.
Conducted feature engineering and preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding).
Compared model performance using metrics like RMSE and R² Score.
Goal: To determine the best regularization technique for accurate housing price prediction.
Dataset: King County House Sales Dataset (Kaggle)
