## 📑 Contents  

### 1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Zomato Dataset  
- Performed in-depth **exploratory data analysis** to uncover patterns in restaurant data.  
- Analyzed factors such as restaurant ratings, cuisines, cost for two, location trends, and user preferences.  
- Visualized relationships between variables using plots and graphs.  
- **Goal**: To provide insights for restaurant businesses and customers by identifying key drivers of customer satisfaction.  
- **Dataset**: [Zomato Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikeshkonapure/zomato)  

### 2️⃣ House Price Prediction (King County Dataset)  
- Built **regression models** (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) to predict house prices based on features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition, and location.  
- Conducted **feature engineering and preprocessing** (handling missing values, scaling, encoding).  
- Compared model performance using metrics like **RMSE** and **R² Score**.  
- **Goal**: To determine the best regularization technique for accurate housing price prediction.  
- **Dataset**: [King County House Sales Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivachandel/kc-house-data/data)

### 3️⃣ A/B Testing Analysis on E-Commerce Conversion Rates
- Conducted an A/B test to evaluate the effectiveness of a new webpage compared to the existing page on an e-commerce website.
- Analyzed conversion rates for control and treatment groups using statistical methods including two-proportion z-test, confidence intervals, power analysis, and sample size calculations.
- Investigated practical significance by comparing observed differences to the chosen Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE = 0.5%).
- Provided actionable recommendations based on statistical and business significance regarding whether to implement the new page.
- **Goal**: To determine if the new webpage increases conversions and to guide data-driven decisions on webpage deployment.
- **Dataset**: [AB Testing Dataset (Kaggle)] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zhangluyuan/ab-testing/data)
